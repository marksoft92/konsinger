After work, I also work for another company, so finding time for this task was very difficult. Moreover, hitting your coding preferences was a lottery, as everyone has a slightly different idea of architecture. For example, I don't keep slices in the Redux folder, but in the features folder, where the main component index is located for a given part of the application.I wrote modest tests, it was also related to time, you wrote that the time was until the end of March, but there was a maximum of 12 hours on git, so I decided that I would spend a maximum of 8 hours on this. Regarding the challenge, it was somewhat similar to the biggest difficulties.",
