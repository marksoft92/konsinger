However, the API didn't have a proper article ID, so I decided to use the article title as the identifier. As a result, I couldn't fetch a single article directly through the REST API. I had to find a workaround and retrieve articles based on their title from my reducer. I'm aware that using a books API could have been better, or perhaps more convenient, for accomplishing this task, but it wasn't a problem for me."
